2014.High1.1	ACGTAACCACGT	GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA	8.349	Cornell	UK_Twins	Cornell	fecal samples from TwinsUK MiSeq runs	TwinsUK Miseq	Jess	MiSeq	This analysis was done as in Caporaso et al 2011 Genome research. The PCR primers F515 and R806 were developed against the V4 region of the 16S rRNA, both bacteria and archaea, which we determined would yield optimal community clustering with reads of this length The reverse PCR primer is barcoded with a 12-base error-correcting Golay code to facilitate multiplexing of up to 1,500 samples per lane, and both PCR primers contain sequencer adapter regions.
